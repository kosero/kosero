I'm an 18-year-old C developer with a strong interest in low-level systems.

My main focus areas are:
- Graphics Programming
- Operating System Development (OSDev)
- Embedded Systems

I enjoy working close to the hardware, understanding how things work under the hood,
and building systems from scratch.

- Primary language: C
- Interested in Rust for systems programming
- Linux user

Currently experimenting with:
- **Sustain** — a game engine for my personal projects (main project)  
- **Bebish** — a custom shell  
- **KiranWM** — a hobby Wayland window manager
